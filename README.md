# [Midao 0.9.0] (http://midao.org)

## About

Midao is created to simplify development with JDBC.

Goal of this project is to shield developer from nuances of vendor JDBC implementation and standard JDBC boilerplate code.

Midao is flexible, customizable, simple/intuitive to use and provides a lot of functionality: transactions, work with metadata, type handling, profiling, input/output processing/converting, pooled datasource libraries support, named parameters, multiple vendor support out of the box, custom exception handling and overrides.

Midao with single jar supports both JDBC 3.0(Java 5) and JDBC 4.0(Java 6).

Midao is well tested, not only it has over 500 unit and functional tests, but also it is tested with latest drivers of: Derby, MySQL (MariaDB), PostgreSQL and Oracle.
